# FLAT ASSIGNMENT : A C++ Finite State Transducer Toolkit


This assignment is a C++ application developed for a Formal Languages and Automata Theory (FLAT) course. It utilizes the **OpenFST** library to build and demonstrate several finite-state transducers (FSTs) that perform various string manipulation tasks.

The application provides an interactive command-line interface to build, visualize, and run FSTs for tasks such as string reversal, case conversion, tokenization, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

* **String Reversal**: Reverses any given input string.
* **Case Conversion**: Converts any given string to uppercase.
* **Digit-to-Word**: Converts a string of digits into their word equivalents (e.g., "123" -> "one two three").
* **Vowel/Consonant Identifier**: Replaces each letter in a string with 'v' for a vowel or 'c' for a consonant.



## üîß Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* An Ubuntu-based Linux distribution (tested on Ubuntu 24.04).
* A C++ compiler, such as `g++`.
* **Anaconda** or **Miniconda**: A Python distribution that includes `conda` for environment and package management.
* **Git** for cloning the repository.
* **Graphviz** for visualizing the FSTs.




  ## üöÄ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the environment and dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

### 2. Set Up the Conda Environment
We will use a dedicated Conda environment to manage the OpenFST dependency.

**a. Create and activate the environment:**
```bash
conda create -n fstenv
conda activate fstenv



**b. Install OpenFST:**
This command installs the OpenFST library and its dependencies from the `conda-forge` channel.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openfst -y
```

**c. Install Graphviz:**
Graphviz is required to generate `.png` diagrams from the `.dot` files created by the application.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install graphviz -y

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Running the Project

Make sure your `fstenv` Conda environment is active before proceeding. All commands below should be executed from the root of the `FLAT-assignment` directory.

### 1. Compile the Application
Run the following `g++` command from the root directory of the project. This command compiles all source files and links them against the OpenFST library installed in your Conda environment.

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I$CONDA_PREFIX/include -Iinclude -L$CONDA_PREFIX/lib src/*.cpp -lfst -o build/fst_app
```

### 2. Set the Library Path
The compiled application needs to know where to find the OpenFST shared libraries at runtime. Export the library path using this command:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
**Note:** You must run this command every time you open a new terminal session before running the application.

### 3. Run the Application
You can now execute the compiled program:

```bash
./build/fst_app
```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage Examples

Once running, the application will present a menu of FST modules. Here are examples of each module in action.


### 1. String Reversal
```
Enter your choice (1-6) or 'q' to quit: 1
Enter input string: Biraj Kalita
üîÅ Reversed string: atilaK jariB
```

### 2. Case Conversion
```
Enter your choice (1-6) or 'q' to quit: 2
Enter input string: Biraj Kalita
üîÅ Case Conversion Output: BIRAJ KALITA
```

### 3. Digit to Word Converter
```
Enter your choice (1-6) or 'q' to quit: 3
Enter input string: 12345
üîÅ Digit to Word Output: one two three four five 
```

### 4. Vowel/Consonant Identifier
```
Enter your choice (1-6) or 'q' to quit: 4
Enter input string: Biraj Kalita
üîÅ Vowel-Consonant Output: C V C V C C C V C V C V 
```



# üî¨ Project Internals & Workflow

### üß† High-Level Overview

At its core, this project is a **modular C++ application** that demonstrates the principles of Finite State Transducers (FSTs). It is not a single, monolithic FST. Instead, it dynamically **builds a new, specialized FST in memory** for every single input string provided by the user.

The architecture is clean and separated:
* `main.cpp` acts as the **user interface** and **dispatcher**.
* Each of the other `.cpp` files in `src/` is a **specialized module** responsible for one specific task (e.g., `case_conversion.cpp`).
* `fst_utils.cpp` is a **shared helper** used by all modules to handle file I/O and diagram generation.



### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Execution Flow

When you run `./build/fst_app`, here is exactly what happens internally:

1.  **The Main Loop Starts (`main.cpp`)**: The program enters an infinite `while` loop. It prints the menu of options (1-6) and waits for user input using `std::getline`.

2.  **Task Dispatching (`main.cpp`)**: Based on the user's choice (e.g., "2" for Case Conversion), the `if-else if` block calls the corresponding function, passing the user's input string to it. For example, if the user chose "2" and typed "Hello", the code effectively runs `caseConversion("Hello");`.

3.  **Module Execution (e.g., `case_conversion.cpp`)**:
    * A new, empty `fst::StdVectorFst` object is created.
    * The code then iterates through each character of the input string ("H", "e", "l", "l", "o").
    * For each character, it creates a new state and adds an **arc** from the previous state to the new one. This arc defines the core logic of the transducer. For `caseConversion`, the arc for 'e' would have an input label of 'e' and an output label of 'E'. This creates a simple, linear chain of states that transforms the input string.
    * The final state in the chain is marked as the "accepting" state.

4.  **Artifact Generation (`fst_utils.cpp`)**: The module (e.g., `caseConversion`) now calls the `saveFSTArtifacts()` function. This is the crucial step for file creation, which is explained in detail in the next section.

5.  **Console Output**: The module calculates the final string in C++ (e.g., by converting "Hello" to "HELLO") and prints it to the console for the user to see.

6.  **Return to Main Loop**: Control returns to `main.cpp`, the "=== Done ===" message is printed, and the loop starts over by displaying the menu again.
